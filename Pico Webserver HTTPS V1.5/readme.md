# Pico Webserver 1.5
Version 1.5 of the server. HTTPs support.
#### Libs 
You will need the 'sdcard.py' lib in order to use an sdcard. Otherwise it is not needed. Copy 'sdcard.py' to the root of your Pico. Or build it into Micropython.
#### How to use Pico Webserver
1. Open web_server.ini in notepad and edit the contents with your setup requirements. SD card doesnt have to be filled out if set to false.
